- Maintain DEPLOY, MIGRATION, PERF, and INTEGRATIONS docs as the single source of truth.
- Document how optional features are enabled (feature flags/env vars, defaults, and rollout steps).
- Capture Cloudflare Pages expectations: build command, output directory, and guard script usage.
- Note known performance patterns (lazy embeds, prefers-reduced-motion) and how to validate them.
